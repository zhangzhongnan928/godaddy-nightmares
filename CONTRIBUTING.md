## Story Guidelines/Template

Please structure your submission (whether an Issue or a Markdown file) using these sections:

* **Platform:** Which domain auction platform did this occur on? (e.g., GoDaddy Auctions, Namecheap Auctions, Sedo, Afternic, etc.)
* **Date(s) of Incident:** When did this happen? (Approximate month/year is fine, e.g., Feb-Apr 2025)
* **Domain Involved:** (Optional) You can include the domain name *if you are comfortable doing so*. You can also anonymize it (e.g., `example-domain.tld`, `highvalue.ai`).
* **Amount Involved:** (Optional) You can provide an approximate range (e.g., "$10k-$25k", "Under $100") rather than exact figures if you prefer.
* **Summary of Issue:** A brief (1-3 sentence) overview of the problem.
* **Timeline of Events:** Describe what happened chronologically. Include key dates if possible (e.g., date of purchase, dates of support contact, date of resolution/cancellation).
* **Support Interaction Summary:** Describe your experience with customer support. Was it helpful? Were there delays? Did you get conflicting information?
* **Resolution (or Lack Thereof):** What was the final outcome? Was the issue resolved? Was a refund issued? Was compensation offered/denied? Is the issue ongoing?
* **Key Takeaway/Warning for Others:** What advice would you give someone based on your experience?

## ⚠️ Anonymity & Personal Identifiable Information (PII)

**This is extremely important.** This repository is public. To protect your privacy, you **MUST NOT** include any PII in your submissions. This includes:

* Your full name, username (if identifiable), or company name (unless you explicitly want to share it).
* Your email address, phone number, or physical address.
* Exact, unique transaction or order IDs (e.g., `Order Number: 3609091194`). You can use placeholders like "[Order ID]" if necessary for context.
* Specific financial details that could link back to you (account numbers, full credit card numbers, exact non-rounded payment amounts tied to specific dates unless generalized).
* Screenshots containing any of the above information.

**Assume anything you post will be public forever. Redact thoroughly.**

## Evidence

While verifiable stories are valuable, **do not upload or directly link to private documents** (emails, receipts, chat logs containing PII). You *can* describe the evidence you have (e.g., "I have email confirmation of the purchase dated X," "I have chat logs showing support agent Y said Z," "I received a cancellation notice citing reason A").

## Review Process

Submissions via Issues will be publicly visible immediately (respecting the PII rules is crucial!). Submissions via Pull Requests may be briefly reviewed by maintainers to check for obvious PII and ensure adherence to the Code of Conduct before merging. We aim to keep the original voice and account intact.

Thank you again for contributing!
