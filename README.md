# GoDaddy Nightmares

## Purpose

This repository serves as a public archive of user-submitted experiences with domain auction platforms, with an initial focus on **GoDaddy Auctions**. Our goal is to raise awareness among potential buyers about pitfalls such as:

* Failed domain transfers after successful auctions.
* Sale of domains not actually owned by the seller.
* Unhelpful or misleading customer support.
* Protracted holding of funds without resolution or compensation.
* Other issues impacting buyers on these platforms.

By sharing these stories, we hope to help others make more informed decisions and encourage platforms to improve their processes and accountability.

## Motivation

This project was inspired by the experience detailed in our first featured story below. We believe sharing such experiences publicly can benefit the wider community.
